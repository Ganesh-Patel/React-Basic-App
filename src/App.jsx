From there, you should be able to start<br></br> making your way, learning from <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/'>the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to<br></br> advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.

          <p>If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold<br></br> your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics<br></br> properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web<br></br> development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class<br></br> materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how<br></br> web technologies work.</p>
